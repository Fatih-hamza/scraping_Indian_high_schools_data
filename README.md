# scraping_Indian_high_schools_data

This program was designed to take data from a website (web scraping) and putting it into an excel file. 
I used the Requests library to talk to the hosting server and take the response, the BeautifulSoup library to extract the data from the content of the response and finally pandas to organize the data and save it into an excel file
